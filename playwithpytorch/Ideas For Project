#So lets make it a place to store some ideas related to that project

##Ideas for things that can be implemented

###NLP:
- Text summarization
- QA system
- ChatBot
>Simple conversations about the specific source
- Book analysis
>Extract the book main characters. Answer questions related to the book


###Cross sections:
- Text summarization of sport news with the prediction of the game outcome based on these

##Some questions that comes to mind

###In context of NLP
- It looks like all of models are trained on predicting the next word.
> Can we do different/better if we change the way we train for?
- Words are being transformed to numbers (in vector form) embedded matrixes
> Can we make a different represenation? What I mean, maybe
> there would be a possibility to make it more robust, open to work in different 'senses' translate from language to image etc.
